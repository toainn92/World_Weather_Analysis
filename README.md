# World Weather Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to update the current PlanMyTripp app based on beta testers feedback. The recommendations were to add the weather description to the weather data and include input statements to filter the data for weather preferences. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Lastly, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route will be created between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## Results
Numpy random module was used to generate latitude and longitude locations. With the these locations, citypy was used to find the neareast city from these coordinates.
